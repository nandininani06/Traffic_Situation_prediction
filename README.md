Prediction of Traffic Situation Based on Vehicle Metrics 🚗📈

📋 Project Overview
This project aims to Predict Traffic Situations (e.g., heavy, moderate, light) based on various vehicle metrics like speed, density, vehicle type, and other real-time parameters.
The goal is to assist in better traffic management, route planning, and congestion reduction using machine learning techniques.
